    <p>Here is the quote of Marilyn Monroe</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes">
      I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of
      control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my
      worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
    </blockquote>
